      <p className="mb-3">
        I am a final year ICT student at Western Sydney University, with a strong passion
        for front-end development. Throughout my academic journey, I've excelled in my
        studies, reflected in my GPA of 6.214/7.0 and recognition on the 2022 & 2023
        Deanâ€™s Merit List. My education has equipped me with a solid foundation in web
        system development, programming techniques, and database design, which I've
        applied in various projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        While front-end development is my area of strength and passion, I also possess a
        well-rounded understanding of back-end development and UI/UX principles. This
        allows me to create websites that are not only visually appealing and functional
        but also user-friendly and optimized for performance.
